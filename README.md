# syntax_sugar [![travis_status](https://travis-ci.org/czheo/syntax_sugar_python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/czheo/syntax_sugar_python) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/syntax_sugar.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/syntax_sugar)

This lib adds some fake "syntactic sugar" to Python.

NOTE: This is merely an experimental prototype to show some potential of operator overloading in Python. Only tested under Python 3.6.0. Anything may evolve without announcement in advance.

Inspired by https://github.com/matz/streem. 

# Install
```
pip install syntax_sugar
```

# Usage
This is the only line you need to use this lib.
```
from syntax_sugar import *
```

### pipe
``` python
# put 10 into the pipe and just let data flow.
pipe(10) | range | each(lambda x: x ** 2) | print
# output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# save the result to a var
x = pipe(10) | range | each(lambda x: x ** 2) | dump()
# remember to call dump at the end, so the pipe will know you want to dump the value

# wanna write to a file? Why not!
pipe(10) | range | (map, str) | concat > 'test.txt'
# write "0123456789" to test.txt
```

### pipe with thread/process and multiprocessing

You can have a function running in a seperate thread with pipe. Just put it in a `[]` or more explicitly `t[]`.

Because of the notorious GIL(Global Interpret Lock) of Python, people may want processes instead of threads. Just put a function in `p[]`.

``` python
pipe(10) | [print]   # print run in a thread
pipe(10) | t[print]  # print run in a thread
pipe(10) | p[print]  # print run in a process
```

What makes this syntax good is that you can specify how many threads you want to spawn, by doing `[function] * n` where `n` is the number of threads.

``` python
pipe([1,2,3,4,5]) | [print] * 3  # print will run in a ThreadPool of size 3
```

Here is an example of requesting a list of urls in parrallel

``` python
import requests
(
pipe(['google', 'twitter', 'yahoo', 'facebook', 'github'])
    | each(lambda name: 'http://' + name + '.com')
    | [requests.get] * 3   # !! `requests.get` runs in a ThreadPool of size 3
    | each(lambda resp: (resp.url, resp.headers.get('Server')))
    | dump()
)

# returns
# [('http://www.google.com/', 'gws'),
#  ('https://twitter.com/', 'tsa_a'),
#  ('https://www.yahoo.com/', 'ATS'),
#  ('https://www.facebook.com/', None),
#  ('https://github.com/', 'GitHub.com')]
```

### infix function
``` python
1 /is_a/ int
# equivalent to `isinstance(1, int)`

1 /to/ 10
# An iterator similar to `range(1, 11)`.
# Python's nasty range() is right-exclusive. This is right-inclusive.

10 /to/ 1
# We can go backward.

'0' /to/ '9'
# We can also have a range of characters :)

1 /to/ 10 /by/ 2
# We can also specify step sizes.
# Similar to `range(1, 11, 2)`

10 /to/ 1 /by/ 2
# Go backward.
# Similar to `range(10, 0, -2)`

'A' /to/ 'Z' /by/ 3
# Also works with characters with /by/.
# An iterator similar to 'ADGJMPSVY'
```

`/to/` has some advanced features

- lazy evaluation.
- support infinity.
- support product operation.

``` python
# CAUTION: this will infinitely print numbers
for i in 1 /to/ INF:
    print(i)

print(1 /to/ INF /take/ 5)
# there is a `take` funciton which is similar to itertools.islice
# return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(0 /to/ NEGINF /by/ 2 /take/ 5)
# also works with negative infinity.
# return [0, -2, -4, -6, -8]

# print all combinations of [1..3] * [4..6]
print([(x, y) for x, y in (1 /to/ 3) * (4 /to/ 6)])
# return [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]
```

Make your own infix function, so you can append multiple items to a list in one line.

``` python
@infix
def push(lst, x):
    lst.append(x)
    return lst

[] /push/ 1 /push/ 2 /push/ 3
# returns [1,2,3]
```

### lazy pipe

Because our `pipe` is quite hard working, it doesn't work well with the lazy `/to/` function. 

`lazy_pipe` works in a "one-by-one" manner. It puts only 1 item into the pipe at each time.

``` python
lazy_pipe(1 /to/ INF) | print | when(lambda x: x < 10)
# this prints 1 to 9

lazy_pipe(input) | (lambda s: s.upper())| print | when(lambda x: x != "")
# lazy_pipe also accepts a function as input. The function is called each time as long as the `when` condition holds.
# this changes anything you input to uppercases.
```

TODO: support multiprocessing with lazy pipe

### composable function

In math, `(f * g) (x) = f(g(x))`. This is called function composition.

``` python
# this transfer a map object to list
lmap = compose(list, map)
# lmap equivalent to `list(map(...))`
lmap(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10))
```

Let's say we want to represent `f * g * h` in a program, i.e. `fn(x) = f(g(h(x)))`

``` python
f = lambda x: x**2 + 1
g = lambda x: 2*x - 1
h = lambda x: -2 * x**3 + 3

fn = compose(f, g, h)

fn(5) # 245026
```

or you can do

```python
f = composable(lambda x: x**2 + 1)
g = composable(lambda x: 2*x - 1)
h = composable(lambda x: -2 * x**3 + 3)

fn = f * g * h

fn(5) # 245026
```

Some times you may prefer the decorator way.

``` python
# make your own composable functions
@composable
def add2(x):
    return x + 2

@composable
def mul3(x):
    return x * 3

@composable
def pow2(x):
    return x ** 2
    
fn = add2 * mul3 * pow2
# equivalent to `add2(mul3(pow2(n)))`
fn(5)
# returns 5^2 * 3 + 2 = 77
```
